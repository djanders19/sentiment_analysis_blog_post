    "When my friends and I were in college and had more flexible schedules we all got into watching English Premier League football. Thanks to my friend Duncan, who was already a fan, many of us wound up as fans of Tottenham (Hotspur or just \"Spurs\" for those who don't follow soccer, not to be confused with the basketball team from San Antonio - here's looking at you Google game results). Unfortunately, once we all got jobs many of the week-day games landed right in the middle of our American workdays due to the time difference. Since it's harder to get away with watching a stream than scrolling reddit at work, I often found myself on the [r/coys](https://www.reddit.com/r/coys) subreddit watching the match thread for big events rather than watching the game itself.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anyone who has spent time on a sports related subreddit knows that redditor fans can be fickle and extreme. If a player allows a goal one game they may be pilloried in the comments section, while a mere game later they may be held up as MOTM if they do something the fan base likes. As a relatively casual fan, it's also not always relatively clear to me _why_ the fans on reddit are angry or happy with a game. Sometimes I'll watch a game and think it's fine, only to find the online fans going berzerk; other times I'll watch the match thread go wild with excitement (over Gareth Bale breathing, for instance) and the match will look pretty shoddy to me. \n",
    "\n",
    "I was discussing this with some friends, and it lead me to wonder how much the comments I read while \"watching\" the match thread actually reflected the content of the game. Specifically, __if I was only basing my emotional experience of the game on the match thread, would I get a similar feel for how things were going as if I was watching?__ My friend Duncan (who, incidentally, is one of the three people this blog derives it's name from) suggested that it could be cool to try to automatically analyze the sentiment of match threads and see how well they reflected actual in-game events. I thought it was a neat idea, and had been wanting to mess about with some NLP, so I gave it a go.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially I attempted to use the native Reddit API, but I found it clunky and slow. Instead, I opted to use the [pushshift endpoints](https://pushshift.io/api-parameters/). This approach has it's drawbacks - notably, it's not updated in real time - but for a simple proof of concept it's speedy, RESTful and easy to use for matches that have already occurred. \n",
    "\n",
    "First we want to get the data for a thread from reddit. We accomplish this using the pushshift.io endpoints; when I was writing this as a script initially I decided to use the [KF Shkendija-Spurs game](https://www.reddit.com/r/coys/comments/iz2b68/match_thread_kf_shkendija_vs_spurs_24_sep_2020/) from September 2020 as an example as at the time it was relatively recent. At the end of this post I'll show some other examples."

As a consequence, reddit comments don't really conform well to a linear list-like data structure - it makes more sense to think of comments as a tree of some sort. This complicates things temporally; if someone makes a particularly controversial comment, people might reply to that comment hours later with some pretty strong language; however, as the match for these comments will appear as much later than the event they relate to, they can't really be seen as indicative of the sentiment at the point in time in a match. \n",

    "Ultimately, what I wanted to do was to run a sentiment analysis of each of these top level comments, and then look at how the overall sentiment of the comments was changing over time in response to the match events. Now, normally for sentiment analysis you'd want to train a bespoke model to your dataset, as people (surprise) use specialized language to talk about specialized topics. For instance, how is a program supposed to interpret \"Shkendija is looking terrible\"? In general, \"terrible\" is a word associated with negative sentiment, but in the context of a pro-Spurs-anti-Shkendija match thread, Shkendija looking terrible is probably best interpreted as a positive sentiment. I thought for about two seconds about building a program that would let me label comments from randomly selected Spurs threads as negative or positive and then using a few thousand of those to train a neural net to rate the positive/negative valence of an arbitrary comment. Then I realized that sounded time-consuming and terrible, and decided to use an off-the-shelf algorithm just to see how it would do. Others have pointed out [problems](http://www.nlp.town/blog/off-the-shelf-sentiment-analysis/) with this approach, but I just figured I'd try things the lazy way first \n",

VADER is far from perfect - it misclassifies things reasonably often, as it's trained on genera social media data. But it's general and easy to use, and I figured since I was looking at _overall_ sentiment of comments rather than sentiment of individual comments it was safe to use an algorithm that might be right _most_ of the time, even if it wasn't right _all_ (or even near all) of the time.\n",

    "We can see that taking the moving average pretty drastically decreases the variability. That's good, in that it is clearer when there's a trend one way or the other in terms of overall sentiment. But does this new plot actually capture anything meaningful about the game?\n",
    "\n",
    "Long story short, yes! Zooming in on the moving average and annotating with a few major game events, we see clear peaks in general spurs-fan sentiment when a goal is scored for Spurs and negative sentiment (indicating upset fans) when KFS scores. Interestingly, we also see a pretty huge trough in sentiment when Harry Winks is awarded a yellow card; it's worth noting that at the time of this game, Winks was a bit of a whipping boy for many Spurs fans, which may attribute to the somewhat precipitous decline.\n",
    "\n",
    "It's also worth noting that the TMA is maybe not the best metric to use as it includes information about events that happen _after_ the point of interest as well as those that occur before - that is, if we're trying to assess sentiment at time _t_, our average is equally affected by the sentiment that occurs at time _t_+5 as at _t_-5. In the context, this doesn't make much sense; the sentiment at time _t_ _can't_ actually be affected by sentiment at time _t_ + _n_ because time _t_ + _n_ hasn't occurred yet! We can see the effect of including future sentiment in our average with the Winks Yellow Card trough: our estimate of sentiment begins to plummet well before he is awarded the Yellow Card, likely due to the impending negative comments."

But even at the lowest point in the game, with the score all tied up right after halftime, sentiment barely drops below zero. While this is admittedly just one game, it does make me question the assumption I see expressed sometimes that Spurs match-threads are generally a negative, hostile environment."

Perhaps this is due to the halftime bump, where fans seem to be more positive in the match thread during halftime; it's hard to know for sure. In this match though we see a lot more variation and peakiness. I didn't watch the match highlights for this one, so I'm not sure what all of the peaks correspond to. However, it's telling that sentiment declines over time: Spurs were forecast to win this game, and they didn't really show up the way they needed to.\n",

In particular, we can see a positive peak for Bergwijn's chance (that was tragically blocked by the post) and then a negative peak afterward in response to the missed shot. Overall though there's a nice give-and-take for the sentiment here, which I think corresponds to how the game felt watching it. Spurs played good football against a juggernaut of an opponent in this match, and there were many moments where it felt like things could go either way.\n",

    "Overall, I think that the VADER analysis worked far better than I expected it to. It's noisy, sure, but it manages to capture the sentiment of the thread in a way that seems to correpond to real events. More importantly, it seems like the actual sentiment in the thread _does_ in fact reflect real events, so if you are like me and find yourself watching the match thread instead of the game... well, it's still really not the same, but the basic emotions you'll witness and experience may be similar.\n",

    "1. Cleaning up the data. I didn't bother accounting for halftime, breaks, and extra time in the match time, so all the match times are slightly off what you'll find in a write up of the game. There are some clever ways to fix this based on the comments themselves, but I didn't bother with implementing them.\n",
    "2. Changing TMA algorithm so it only takes into account comments from the past/present moment being evaluated, not from one's _after_ the moment being evaluated (think of this as \"Right-triangle moving average\"\n",
    "3. Figure out how to snag reddit comments in real time, so you can track sentiment of a match continuously while it's underway.\n",
    "4. Implement this all into a dashboard so that people can analyze any ol' thread without having to muck about with code.\n",
